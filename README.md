# 🌐 Language Detection Machine Learning Model

This project is a **machine learning model** that automatically detects the language of a given input text using **Naive Bayes classification**. It was developed using **Google Colab** and is built with core Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

The model performs feature extraction on textual data, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and trains a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of input text.
