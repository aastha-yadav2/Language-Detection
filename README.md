# 🌐 Language Detection using Naive Bayes

This project is a beginner-level machine learning model that detects the **language of a given text** using a **Naive Bayes Classifier**. It helped me understand the foundation of text processing and model training in machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook-based project performs:
- Feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`
- Splitting data with `train_test_split`
- Training a `MultinomialNB` model from `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating predictions on multilingual input text

Developed entirely on **Google Colab**.

## 💡 Learning Note

This is my **first machine learning project**, and I followed a helpful **YouTube tutorial** to complete it. I learned:
- Preprocessing for NLP
- Model training with Naive Bayes
- Using Scikit-learn in Colab
- Interpreting predictions

Excited to take on more advanced ML challenges next!
